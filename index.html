            This site is mostly a log of what I actually build: supply chain and logistics work,
            data-heavy projects, and a longer investigation that sits somewhere between economics and
            engineering. The design is here to stay out of the way.

              <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Operations needed a way to compare scenarios under changing
                energy, labor, and material costs without guessing on margins.</li>
              <li><strong>What I built:</strong> A model that ingests cost drivers and demand assumptions,
                runs scenarios, and outputs projected margins and risk bands.</li>
              <li><strong>Stack:</strong> Python, pandas, basic simulation logic, Excel / Power BI for the
                front-end.</li>
              <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Makes it obvious how margin shifts when one cost driver moves,
                instead of burying assumptions in spreadsheets.</li>

            Short version of how I ended up caring this much about logistics, data, and getting out of the
            “okay at everything” zone.
          </p>
        </header>

        <div class="about-body">
          <p>
            I’m a final-year Industrial Engineering student from Mexicali, currently working as a remote
            logistics analyst and building data-heavy projects around supply chains and economics.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grew up as the younger brother following a very strong act – same school, same sports, same
            cities. For a long time I was “good enough” at everything, but never the one people pointed to.
            Over the last couple of years, that changed: I started doing real work in logistics, building
            systems around data instead of just using tools, and aiming for places that used to feel out of
            reach.
          </p>
          <p>
            This site is mostly a record of that shift: what I build, the questions I’m chasing, and what
            I’m currently learning.
