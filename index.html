            Right now that means: logistics flows, manufacturing costs, and data pipelines that tie
            operations to real decisions. This page is a snapshot of that work: a couple of serious
            projects, an ongoing investigation, and a log of what I’m training on.

            The short version: map the flow, instrument it, then design the smallest system that actually
            changes behavior.

            <p>
              Start with the real flow: materials, information, decisions. Swimlanes, hand-offs,
              constraints. No buzzwords, just “what actually happens?”.

            <h3>02 · Measure</h3>
            <p>
              Pick a few metrics that matter (lead time, service level, margin, failure rate) and wire
              data around them. If we can’t measure it, we can’t argue about it properly.

            <h3>03 · Model</h3>
            <p>
              Use models to explore scenarios and trade-offs: routing choices, inventory policies,
              production plans. The goal is insight, not a black box.

              engineering mindset meets day-to-day operations.

        <div class="about-body">
          <p>
            I’m a final-year Industrial Engineering student from Mexicali, working as a remote logistics
            analyst and building projects at the intersection of process engineering, data systems, and
            economics.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grew up as the younger brother following a very strong act – same school, same sports,
            same cities. For a long time I was good at a lot of things but never really owned one.
            Over the last couple of years, that changed: I started doing real work in logistics,
            building systems around data instead of just using tools, and aiming for places that used
            to feel out of reach.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page is a record of that shift: the processes, projects, and questions I’m using to
            get there.
